# Labyrinth Solver
This program uses a depth-first search algorithm to solve for a valid path of a labyrinth when given a text file that contains the labyrinth's parameters. A graph class was created in order to store the labyrinth data and was implemented using an adjacency list. Example text files are given for testing purposes. The program was writting in Java 8 and was developed as an assignment for a Data Structures and Algorithms course at the University of Western Ontario, of which full marks were received. Part of the code was provided by the course, but the following classes were original code: Edge.java, Graph.java, Node.java, Labyrinth.java.
